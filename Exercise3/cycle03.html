			<p>Seeing the parade of motorcycles from all over the United States was super exciting. They brought pins and patches from al lover the United States and put them on a sash to decorate my wheelchair.</p>
			<p>After so many days of pain and boredom, seeing the Cycle Out Cancer riders was a real thrill! ~Jennifer</p>
			<p>I spent 10 days in the hospital just crying. The Cycle Out Cancer guys were so colorful and generous. They gave the hospital a very generous donation in my name and showed me that even strangers care about me. ~Kristen</p>
			<p>I had the good forune to meet several Cycle Out Cancer guys. Everyone has been touched by cancer. They are out there doing something about it. ~Fritz</p>
